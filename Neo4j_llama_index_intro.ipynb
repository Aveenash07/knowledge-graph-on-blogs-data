For an informative analysis, | have included my\\npersonal view on media power and discussed communication as the main factor in creating hybrid public space, and\\n\\nencouraged the public to use media as an interactive tool in the field of social society.\\n\\nThe research proposes for reconsideration of media role in creating imaginative and narrative communication avenues\\nin achieving a highly informed society. Our deductive approach touches on audiences’ thoughts, the way they reinterpret\\n\\nthe message, and sediment new knowledge into their daily lives.\\n\\nIt is evidenced that media for social change has enabled the creation of new avenues for grassroots activism and\\ncommunity building. | aim at learning the degree to which media for social change is used and the role of leadership in\\nthis industry. | will conduct a series of interviews with media professionals to find out their attitudes and beliefs in\\nregard to a leadership role in social change. However, the best test, and yet difficult to comprehend, is: do media\\nchange how we function, how we communicate, and more likely become independent? And does it encourage social\\nties? It is evidenced that media for social change has enabled new avenues for grassroots activism and community\\n\\nbuilding.\\n\\nTo do answer this question, we will follow the hypothesis approach of research using quantitative research tools. First,\\nwe will present Paul Ricoeur and Habermas’s theory behind the topic from previous literature. Then we will state our\\nhypotheses on the different relationships. Next, we are going to use interviews to collect some data and analyze it, and\\n\\nfinally, discuss whether the results support our hypotheses and state conclusions and recommendations.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nMedia plays an important role in creating and influencing the opinion of the public. It does this by linking the ideas of\\nthe producers with their audience whereby the producers pass down their themes to their audience hence changing\\nthe way they perceive certain issues. According to Alia (2004), there exists a direct relationship between the change in\\n\\nthe society and what the media producers are giving the society.\\n\\nIn this relationship, the role of media producers is to generate information from a chain of relations and influences and\\nthe role of the audience is to infer and evaluate the information from the producers and generate other information\\nexternal to the media perspectives. The impacts and implications of the media account not just the way interesting\\nevents are identified, as Ricoeur in the From text to Action, states, but also to a wide range of cultural influences that\\n\\nfunction via the media (Ricoeur1990).\\n\\nRecent research efforts suggest that the media have powerful social and cultural effects on society. This is a result of\\ntheir capability to reach a broad range of audiences with a powerful and transforming message. Alia in work tells us\\nthat the media is the message when trying to how the circulation of a message is more significant than what is in the\\nmessage itself (Alia 2004). The use of media elements such as films, radio, and printed media transmits the producer’s\\n\\nmessage to his or her targeted listeners.\\n\\x0c\\n\\nPage # 2\\nAnd as such the media have been very influential in shaping society’s everyday life and opinions. Particularly, the TV has\\nwide control over what the society watches and as such is capable of manipulating their opinions. Moreover, the\\ninternet provides room for more varied political ideas, social and cultural perspectives and as such it has increased the\\n\\ndegree of audience participation.\\n\\nIt can be said that people will always be influenced by media in a number of ways but however, this hinges on what the\\ntarget audience wants to get from reading an article or watching a film. The idea could be established that media\\nelements such as new stories as seen in television plays a significant role in society as it offers its target audiences\\nwith understandings that make them aware of issues that producers feel their target audience ought to know\\n\\n(Habermas 1985).\\n\\nFor instance, a TV program will at all times influence its target audiences in a number of ways since it is perceived as a\\ntrustworthy source of information that notifies them of what they do not know and as such shows the truths in their\\nmidst. For this reason, it can then be argued that programs like the TV news programs assists their target audience in\\ncreating a picture and an opinion of specific ideas and issues which time and again reflect the news’ beliefs. In short,\\nthere will constantly be an aspect of the producer of a TV program that he or she wants his or her target population to', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')"
